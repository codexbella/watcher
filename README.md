### - watcher'n'chill

Watcher lets users save the info of their favorite tv shows on their personal Watcherlist, rate those shows and track their viewing progress.

The site supports English and German and is hosted on [Heroku](https://watcher-n-chill.herokuapp.com) (current version as soon as Heroku and Github settle their differences on security issues).

The infos come from the API of TMDb (The Movie Database).
